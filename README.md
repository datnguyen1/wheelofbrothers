A game created by Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity brothers when we hang out turned into code


Code developed using chatGPT with prompt below:

Help me write a program using Python. 

User is going to input a list of names (list of players remaining using the instances alive or dead status)

Let's make an object that takes in names from the list and create instance of these names. Under these objects are attributes health: 10 and status: alive or dead

we going to write a spin the wheel, it is going to choose 2 names randomly, using the list of names as parameter and return 2 names from the list of names.

The names chosen from the return of spin the wheel are going the pick the equivalent instance created. Create a function that is called fightday and put the instances into a fight as parameters. Print out the players’ name, health after spinning the wheel The program is going to ask who won the fight. And because after fighting the winner will receive damage (deduct from instance’s health) so we will ask how many damage taken and minus that from instance’s health . We will automatically eliminate the loser (eliminate by changing instance’s status to dead from list of names (list of players remaining). The winner is going to receive damage and deduct from current health. And each time this function is called the alive status players will plus 1 health from resting (except the one that were passed through the parameters).

Names of brothers in gentlemen:...

Improvements: Display only alive players
